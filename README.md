With a modern design and streamlined checkout process, users can explore and purchase products seamlessly. Powered by Django and enriched with JavaScript for interactivity, the platform prioritizes customer satisfaction.

	
Frontend Languages/Framework/Libraries:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
HTML is used to structure the content of web pages. It defines the layout and organization of elements on the page, providing the foundation for the user interface.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
CSS is used for styling HTML elements, defining the visual appearance of the web pages. It controls aspects such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layout, enhancing the overall design and user experience.

Bootstrap:
Bootstrap is a front-end framework that provides pre-designed components, CSS styles, and JavaScript plugins for building responsive and mobile-friendly web interfaces. It streamlines development, ensures consistency in design, and accelerates the creation of user interface elements.

JavaScript:
JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It is used to create interactive elements, handle user events, and perform client-side validation. JavaScript frameworks and libraries like jQuery can also be utilized to simplify DOM manipulation and enhance functionality.

Backend Languages/Framework/Libraries: 

Java Servlets:
Java Servlets are server-side Java components that handle requests and responses between the client and the server. They are used to process user input, execute business logic, and generate dynamic content for the web application.

JavaServer Pages (JSP):
JSP allows for the creation of dynamic web pages using Java code embedded within HTML markup. It enables the integration of Java code with HTML to generate dynamic content and interact with backend components.

MySQL:
MySQL is a relational database management system used for storing and retrieving data in the backend of the web application. It provides a robust and scalable solution for data storage, enabling efficient management of user information, product details, and other application data.

Java Development Kit (JDK):
JDK is a software development kit used for developing Java applications. It includes tools and libraries necessary for compiling, debugging, and running Java programs, making it essential for backend development using Java Servlets and JSP.

Eclipse EE IDE:
Eclipse EE IDE is an integrated development environment specifically designed for Java EE (Enterprise Edition) development. It provides tools and features for writing, testing, and deploying Java web applications, facilitating efficient backend development and debugging processes.

The Best/Unique Feature of your Project:
1. Categories Option: Simplifies product discovery, aiding user navigation.
2. Brand Selection: Enables informed choices, fostering user trust and loyalty.
3. Discount Feature: Incentivizes purchases, boosting sales and attracting price-conscious shoppers.

Project and Lab Topics Synchronization:
1. In our project, we've used object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, like inheritance, for smoother implementation.
2. We've created and implemented interfaces to make our code modular and clear.
3. Control flow structures like if-else statements have been used for efficient program flow.
4. Attributes and methods have been carefully defined for robustness and maintainability.
5. Getter and setter methods in our POJO folder ensure secure data access.
6. Exception handling has been included for resilient error management.
